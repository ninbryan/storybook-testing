# Storybook testing

Setup, develop, and test components with Storybook,
an open source tool for isolated component driven development.

In the recent releases of Storybook,
they have integrated support of various frameworks and libraries
such as React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and regular JavaScript DOM.

In our projects, we want to develop a reusable component library
for our work plus test and find the edge cases of our components.

Tonight we'll explore the vast capabilities Storybook has to offer.

## Intro on Storybook

The key word here is "story"

A story is involves the narrative of a certain individual,
in this case a component,
and entails the journey of this component.

In Storybook, we are given the tool to explore components and their potential.
In some stories, it is fairly interactive while others are not so much.
Then there are components that are the amalgation of other components.

Let's start with Button, a modest --character-- component.
Button begins its life as a simple html element, no styles for now no actions.
But we here to test our creations, our components...

At some point, you'll need a special button capable of taking on all sorts of roles.

It's a blend of HTML, style, and status!

I'm omitting style for the moment.

Realizing the requirements, we get into the details.
