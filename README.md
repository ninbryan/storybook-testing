# Storybook testing

Setup, develop, and test components with Storybook,
an open source tool for isolated component driven development.

In the recent releases of Storybook,
they have integrated support of various frameworks and libraries
such as React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and regular JavaScript DOM.

In our projects, we want to develop a reusable component library
for our work plus test and find the edge cases of our components.

Tonight we'll explore the vast capabilities Storybook has to offer.
